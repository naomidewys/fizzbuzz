<h1> FizzBuzz Game </h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I'm currently completing the Complete Python Pro Bootcamp with Dr. Angela Yu from the London App Brewery. One of the mini challenges was to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game using For loops and range(). </p>
<p>I used this challenge to create a game that allows the user to input their own numbers into the range. This helped me practice my coding skills of creating For loops and ranges, inputting integers, and using conditional statements and modulos.</p>
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p>I learned that the first number in a range is inclusive, but the other number is not. Therefore, I had to add "+ 1" to the second input to ensure the range covered the entire selection that the user requested. For example, if the user selected 1 and 100, the range showed (number1, number2 + 1). I also learned that a third variable can be added to skip a number set. For example, range(1, 101, 3) would include a range from 1 to 100 but only show every third number. However, this was not something I included in my game.</p>
